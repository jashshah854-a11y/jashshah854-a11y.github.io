# Portfolio improvement loop

One verified change per round. Numbers are phone tier (390x844, iPhone UA) draw calls unless noted.
Gate per round: no console errors except resume.pdf 404; deep link, Back restore and back-to-hall pass at 390x844, 1366x768, 1440x900; all 14 stops reachable; live routes 200 after the Pages build.

## Backlog (top = next)
- [ ] Vitrine sits at the budget line (100 settled, 102 peak). Next cut: the Perpetua machine is 34 separate meshes in its own vitrine; parts that never move relative to each other can share a draw.
- [ ] Phone first content: veil now ~3.1 s on a 4G-throttled phone locally (was ~6 s live). Re-measure live; next lever is the JS module waterfall (three.core + three.module + gsap before first frame).
- [ ] Occasional video-decode hitch in desktop transit between worlds.
- [ ] Landscape phone layout (never designed).
- [ ] Reduced-motion and keyboard paths through the tour.
- [ ] Resume link: add resume.pdf ONLY when Jash hands over the approved file.

## Rounds

### Round 1 (2026-10-10): static batching now merges non-indexed geometry
- Cause: hall.js static batching skipped any geometry without an index. RoundedBoxGeometry is non-indexed, so every deck and both brass trims on each station drew on their own.
- Change: batch key now carries indexed/non-indexed, so each kind merges with its own kind (mergeGeometries needs all one or the other).
- Phone calls, before -> after: vitrine 152 -> 129, hall 70 -> 61, decks 71 -> 61, end 104 -> 88, worlds ~34 -> ~33. No stop got worse. Screenshots identical.
- Gate: PASS at all three sizes. Commit 83cfee0.

### Round 2 (2026-10-10): the nine drive shafts draw as three instanced meshes
- Note: the 20-minute wakeup after round 1 never fired; round 2 ran four hours late, by hand.
- Cause: each shaft was 4 meshes (body, keys, 2 collars), kept apart because it spins and hides on its own: 36 draws on wide views.
- Change: hall.js builds one InstancedMesh each for bodies, keys and collars; the spin driver writes the matrices, a hidden shaft collapses to zero scale.
- Phone calls, before -> after: vitrine 129 -> 100, hall 61 -> 50, end 88 -> 62. World close-ups 33 -> 36 (the instanced shafts are never culled; still far under budget).
- Gate: PASS at all three sizes; shafts look the same in the hall shot. Commit 4899a17.

### Round 3 (2026-10-10): phones fetch 1024 px picture copies
- Cause: phones downloaded every gallery picture at full size (1440 to 1672 px, up to 390 KB) and then shrank it to 1024 px on a canvas. 6.3 MB in the first 15 s on a phone.
- Change: m/ holds 1024 px copies (q82, progressive) of the 30 pictures the gallery uses, same paths under m/. portal.js loads the copy on the phone tier and falls back to the full picture if a copy is missing.
- Phone, 4G throttle (9 Mbps, 60 ms): first 15 s download 6274 KB -> 3431 KB. Veil 6078 ms (live, before) -> 3158 ms (local, after; live re-measure below).
- Gate: PASS at all three sizes. Phone picture stays sharp in the Fieldfold shot.
- Note: regenerate m/ when a gallery picture changes (outputs/portfolio/loop/small.py).
